# iOS Hybrid App Conversion

## Overview
This document tracks the process of converting our Next.js web application to a hybrid iOS app using React Native for Web while maintaining our existing web functionality.

## Goals
- Create a native iOS app experience
- Maintain existing web functionality
- Reuse Firebase authentication and backend
- Continue using OpenAI integration
- Support easy rollback if needed

## Implementation Strategy
1. Set up React Native for Web in the Next.js project
2. Add platform-specific components with feature detection
3. Implement native navigation that mirrors web routing
4. Adapt UI components for mobile experience
5. Configure iOS build process

## Rollback Procedure
If the conversion proves unsuccessful:
1. Return to main branch: `git checkout staging`
2. Continue web-only development
3. No migration of data needed as backend remains unchanged

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- [x] Install React Native for Web dependencies
- [x] Configure Next.js to work with React Native components
- [x] Create platform detection utilities
- [x] Test basic component rendering

### Phase 2: Component Adaptation
- [x] Create initial app.tsx entry point for iOS app
- [x] Complete navigation system adaptation
- [x] Convert key UI components
- [x] Implement responsive layouts for both platforms

### Phase 3: Native Functionality
- [x] Implement camera access for wine label photos
- [x] Add push notifications framework
- [x] Optimize animations for mobile

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- [x] Set up iOS project structure
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator
- [x] Create iOS build process
- [ ] Prepare App Store submission

## Current Status
Full implementation is complete. We have:
- Installed React Native dependencies
- Added React Native Web configuration to Next.js
- Created platform detection utilities
- Built a complete navigation system with React Navigation
- Implemented all core screens (Home, WineDetail, MyList, Auth, Profile, Settings)
- Added camera integration for wine label photos
- Set up responsive layout system for both platforms
- Created iOS-specific configuration files

Next steps:
1. Test on iOS simulator
2. Fine-tune UI/UX on native devices
3. Prepare for App Store submission

## Documentation
See the README-HYBRID.md file for detailed instructions on building and running the app on both web and iOS platforms.
