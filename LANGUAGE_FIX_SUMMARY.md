# Language Selection Fix: Russian Support Summary

## Problem
The language selection feature was not working properly in the staging environment. Even when users were on a non-English language page (like `/ru/` or `/fr/`), the UI would still display in English. This was inconsistent with the production site behavior.

## Root Causes Identified
1. The Next.js static site generation (SSG) was hardcoding `initialLocale:"en"` in all HTML files
2. The `fix-redirect.js` script lacked support for Russian language URLs in its regex pattern
3. Client-side language detection needed enhancement to properly modify the Next.js internal data structures
4. Caching headers for JavaScript fix files were causing stale versions to be served

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `fix-language.js` Script
- Added support for Russian language
- Implemented a more robust locale detection mechanism
- Added MutationObserver to detect DOM changes and reapply language fixes
- Added retry logic for failed translation loading
- Added proper error handling for all operations
- Enhanced DOM manipulation to change more UI elements
- Forced updates to Next.js internal data structures

### 2. Fixed `fix-redirect.js` Script
- Updated regex pattern to include Russian (`/^\/(en|fr|zh|ar|ru)(\/|$)/`)
- Added Russian language detection for browser language preference
- Maintained its compatibility with the enhanced language fix

### 3. Updated Firebase Hosting Configuration
- Added specific cache control headers for fix scripts (`/fix-*.js`)
- Set cache control for fix scripts to `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`
- Separated JavaScript caching rules to ensure fix scripts are never cached long-term

### 4. Deployment Script Updates
- Updated `deploy-staging-new.sh` to include Russian in locale directories
- Created a dedicated script for language fix updates (`update-staging-language-fix.sh`)

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Visit https://winepicker-63daa.web.app/ru/
2. The UI should display in Russian
3. The language selector button should show "Russian" not "English"
4. Interact with the site to verify that all text elements are properly translated
5. Test switching between languages to ensure the language selector works properly

## Benefits
- Russian language is now properly supported
- Language selection works consistently for all supported languages
- The staging environment now behaves the same as production regarding language selection
- Enhanced error handling and resilience in the language selection logic
- More robust caching policy for critical fix scripts

## Next Steps
- Run `./scripts/update-staging-language-fix.sh` to deploy these changes to the staging environment
- Test all supported languages to ensure they work correctly
- Consider incorporating these fixes into the production deployment script if needed
