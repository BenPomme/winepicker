# Project Cleanup Report

## Actions Completed

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs` directory
- Added branching strategy guidelines
- Added deployment instructions
- Added Firebase configuration guide
- Added contribution guidelines
- Updated main README with improved instructions

### Project Structure
- Created a `.gitignore` file that excludes build artifacts, node modules, etc.
- Created example environment files (`.env.example` and `functions/.env.example`)
- Created a directory structure for tests (`/tests/api`, `/tests/ui`, `/tests/integration`)
- Created a backup branch (`backup-before-cleanup`) with the full project state

### Version Control
- Untracked build artifacts that should not be in version control
- Committed all cleanup changes
- Created a list of remote branches for potential cleanup

## Pending Actions

### Branch Cleanup
Consider removing the following outdated branches:
```
feature/background-processing
feature/enhanced-wine-recommendations
feature/enhancements-v2
feature/fix-cors-and-api-routing
feature/openai-only
fix-hardcoded-values
fix/firestore-document-size-limit
hotfix/openai-only
preview/openai-only
test-no-bs-with-snippets
vercel-production
```

Review these branches and delete ones that are no longer needed:
```bash
# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Delete local branch (if it exists)
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

### Incomplete Tasks
1. Need to organize test files from the root into the `tests` directory
2. Should set up proper deployment CI/CD process

## Recovery Plan

If any issues arise, you can revert to the backup branch:
```bash
git checkout backup-before-cleanup
```

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Review and delete obsolete branches
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
4. Standardize deployment process using the documentation
