# Project Cleanup Report

## Latest Actions (April 2025)

### Deployment Process Improvements
- Resolved redirect loop issues in production environment
- Successfully deployed staging build 2c23f0 to production
- Updated `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions
- Created a consolidated deployment script `deploy-consolidated.sh` with support for:
  - Multiple deployment targets (staging, production, functions)
  - Direct clone method (reliable staging-to-production deployment)
  - Better error handling and user guidance
- Standardized Firebase configuration across environments
- Identified the most reliable deployment method (direct clone)

### File & Script Consolidation
- Created single consolidated deployment script to replace multiple redundant scripts
- Marked deprecated scripts for removal:
  - `deploy.sh` - Outdated GitHub Pages deployment
  - `deploy-firebase.sh` - Using incorrect project
  - `deploy-new.sh` - Incomplete deployment script
  - `deploy-current-to-production.sh` - Functionality now in consolidated script
  - `manual-deploy.sh` - Excessively complex script with redundant functionality

## Previous Actions Completed

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs` directory
- Added branching strategy guidelines
- Added deployment instructions
- Added Firebase configuration guide
- Added contribution guidelines
- Updated main README with improved instructions

### Project Structure
- Created a `.gitignore` file that excludes build artifacts, node modules, etc.
- Created example environment files (`.env.example` and `functions/.env.example`)
- Created a directory structure for tests (`/tests/api`, `/tests/ui`, `/tests/integration`)
- Created a backup branch (`backup-before-cleanup`) with the full project state

### Version Control
- Untracked build artifacts that should not be in version control
- Committed all cleanup changes
- Created a list of remote branches for potential cleanup

## Pending Actions

### Branch Cleanup
Consider removing the following outdated branches:
```
feature/background-processing
feature/enhanced-wine-recommendations
feature/enhancements-v2
feature/fix-cors-and-api-routing
feature/openai-only
fix-hardcoded-values
fix/firestore-document-size-limit
hotfix/openai-only
preview/openai-only
test-no-bs-with-snippets
vercel-production
```

Review these branches and delete ones that are no longer needed:
```bash
# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Delete local branch (if it exists)
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

### File Cleanup
Remove the following redundant files after stabilization period:
1. Redundant deployment scripts (once consolidated script is validated)
2. Temporary fix scripts in `scripts/` directory that are no longer needed
3. Backup configuration files (`*.bak`)

### Incomplete Tasks
1. Need to organize test files from the root into the `tests` directory
2. Should set up proper deployment CI/CD process

## Recovery Plan

If any issues arise with the new deployment process:
1. Use the direct clone method to restore from working build:
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:clone winepicker-63daa:live pickmywine-live:live
   ```
2. If needed, revert to an older branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout backup-before-cleanup
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Establish reference build 2c23f0 as the new baseline
3. Review and delete obsolete branches
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
5. Start regular maintenance procedures (log rotation, temporary file cleanup)
