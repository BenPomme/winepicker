# Pick My Wine

An elegant wine selection app to help you find the perfect wine for any occasion.

## Features

- **Wine Recognition**: Take a photo of a wine menu or bottle to instantly get ratings

## Setup

### OpenAI API Key

This app uses OpenAI's API for wine analysis. To set up your own API key:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
2. Replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key
3. Restart the app

Never commit your actual API key to Git. The `.env` file is already in the `.gitignore`.

## How to Use

1. **Scan Wines**: Tap the camera icon to take a photo of a wine menu or select one from your gallery
2. **View Ratings**: See instant ratings and reviews for each wine detected
3. **Set Preferences**: Tap the wine glass icon to set your pairing preferences (meat, fish, etc.)
4. **Explore Details**: Tap on any wine card to see detailed information
5. **Filter Options**: Use the filter icon to find wines within your price range
6. **Sort Wines**: Tap the sort icon to arrange wines by rating, price, or preference match
