## Build Reference Information

Current reference build: **2c23f0** (April 2025)

This build has been thoroughly tested and is working correctly in both staging and production environments. It supports all required languages and functionality.

## Recommended Best Practices

1. **Deployment**:
   - Always deploy to staging first
   - Verify functionality in staging (all languages)
   - Use direct clone method for staging-to-production deployment

2. **Maintenance**:
   - Run log rotation script weekly (`./scripts/log-rotation.sh`)
   - Keep firebase.json configurations synchronized
   - Document any changes to the deployment process

3. **Development**:
   - Follow branch naming conventions
   - Test language functionality with each change
   - Update documentation with significant changes

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement automated testing for language selection
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for consistent deployments
- [ ] Remove deprecated scripts after validation period
- [ ] Clean up old branches

## Recovery Options

If issues occur:
1. Use direct clone to restore from a known working version
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:clone winepicker-63daa:live pickmywine-live:live
   ```

2. Reference the backup files in `cleanup/backup/` if needed

## Final Notes

The project is now in a stable state with build 2c23f0 serving as the reference standard. All future development should build on this foundation with careful attention to maintaining the multilingual functionality.
